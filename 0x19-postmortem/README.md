Issue Summary:
Duration: 2022-12-30 07:00 PM to 2022-12-31 01:00 AM PST
Impact: The website was down for 5 hours, affecting 100% of users. They were unable to access the site or place any orders.
Root Cause: The root cause was a server failure due to high network traffic during a flash sale event.

Timeline:

2022-12-30 07:00 PM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts were triggered for high server load and low memory usage.
2022-12-30 07:15 PM: A senior engineer was notified and investigated the issue.
2022-12-30 07:30 PM: The initial assumption was that the issue was caused by a DDoS attack. The engineer investigated the network traffic logs and firewall rules, but found no signs of an attack.
2022-12-30 08:00 PM: The engineer escalated the issue to the operations team, and they started investigating the server load and resource usage.
2022-12-30 09:00 PM: After extensive investigation, the team determined that the root cause was a server failure due to high network traffic during a flash sale event.
2022-12-30 10:00 PM: The operations team replaced the failed server and restored the site.
2022-12-31 01:00 AM: The site was fully functional and all services were restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a server failure due to high network traffic during a flash sale event. The high traffic overwhelmed the server resources, causing the server to crash. The operations team replaced the failed server and restored the site.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, the following tasks will be performed:

Increase server resources to handle high traffic events.
Implement load balancing to distribute network traffic evenly across multiple servers.
Monitor server resource usage more closely during high traffic events.
Implement failover mechanisms to ensure seamless transitions to backup servers in case of a failure.
In conclusion, this issue was caused by a combination of high network traffic and insufficient server resources. The operations team was able to quickly identify and resolve the issue, and preventative measures have been put in place to avoid similar incidents in the future.
